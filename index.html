        By day, the Street is the province of Corporate movers and commuting Beavers.
         But at night, the predators slither out from under their rocks and trash heaps, and the City howls. 

      Call them gutterats, night crawlers, trash or streetscum; the gangs are the ultimate rulers of the city's night.
       Whether it's a small pack of a dozen, or an army of two hundred, each gang in Night City is as diverse as the Street itself; guardians, chromers, dorphers and freaks, all thrown together in a lethal cocktail, mixed and sprinkled liberally with blood. 

      Gangs can be found all over the United States in various different shapes and sizes.
       In the Cyberpunk universe gangs can also be seen from Japan, and Europe.

       <p>The following weapons can be found in Cyberpunk 2077.
        Weapons typically fall under pistols, shotguns, and rifles, and they can be either Tech, Power, or Smart. 
        A large percentage of weapons can fit modules that can change they way they handle, those modules being Tech, Smart, or Power.
        Players may acquire a Tech pistol but can then replace the module so it becomes a Power or Smart pistol.
        Gameplay mechanics can change based on modules and modules will also have rarities attached.</p> 
        
        <p>Weapons are manufactured by 12 corporations in the Cyberpunk 2077 universe.
        Weapons availability are based on the class of weapons of the manufactures.
        Each manufacture is under either Lower, Middle, or Upper Tier.
        The higher the tier the more rare and expensive the weapons are.</p>

          Cars are equipped with AI allowing V to call them, and they will drive towards her.
           So, vehicles can be left anywhere and called on demand. Only one selected vehicle can be used in this manner at a time though.
            Others will be stored in a parking garage at V's apartment complex.
          Cars cannot be customized, although V can still find and drive pre-made custom cars in Night City.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Cyberpunk 2077 there are 12 cyberpunk original and 2 real world vehicle manufactures available in Night City.
           V can obtain these vehicles through either purchasing them or stealing them and putting them in the Megabuilding.
            Cars will be harder to buy or steal based on their class, the class is based on the brand that vehicle is manufactured from.
             Brands range from Lower, Middle, to Upper tiers with a separate class being known as Motorcycles.
